# AI Flower Identification

A flower classification web application built with TensorFlow/Keras for the model backend and Streamlit as the front-end UI. The app uses a model trained on the Oxford 102 Flowers dataset to identify 102 different flower species from an uploaded image.

## Features

  * **Deep Learning Model**: Uses a DenseNet201-based model trained on the Oxford 102 Flowers dataset.
  * **Web Interface**: Clean, minimalistic, and responsive UI built with Streamlit.
  * **Elegant Styling**: Custom CSS styling inspired by the aesthetic of [flowers.stair.center](https://flowers.stair.center/).
  * **Simple to Use**: Drag-and-drop image uploader for instant classification of JPG, JPEG, and PNG files.
  * **Detailed Predictions**: Displays the top 5 flower predictions with their corresponding confidence scores.

## Setup

### Requirements

  * Python 3.8+
  * TensorFlow & Keras
  * Streamlit
  * Pillow & Numpy
  * TensorFlow Datasets

### Installation

1.  **Create `requirements.txt`**: Create a file named `requirements.txt` in your project directory with the following content:

    ```
    tensorflow
    streamlit
    Pillow
    numpy
    tensorflow-datasets
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**: Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to install the required packages:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1.  **Place Files**: Ensure that `app.py`, `densenet201_oxfordflowers_best.keras`, and `cat_to_name.json` are all in the same directory.

2.  **Run the Application**: In your terminal, run the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

3.  **Access the App**: Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501`.

4.  **Upload an Image**: Drag and drop a flower image or click to upload one to receive the AI's prediction.
